KittyInSpace
============

Kitty In Space! is a game written in Processing, intended for use with a custom 
controller I built out of a box and a makeymakey.

The game is about a daring astronaut cat who came out of light speed in the middle
of a flock of space ships piloted by birds. In order to escape, Kitty needs to fight
off the Birds long enough for hyperdrive to recharge for a final jump to light speed!

How To Play :

Movement : Arrow Keys
Weapons : 

1, 2, 3 - First Slot
4, 5, 6 - Second Slot
7, 8, 9 - Third Slot

1, 4, 7 - Load Mouse Missiles
2, 5, 8 - Load Spray Attack
3, 6, 9 - Load Targeted Attack

a - Charge / Fire First Slot
s - Charge / Fire Second Slot
d - Charge / Fire Third Slot

The controls are a bit unwieldy on a keyboard, and the game was designed with the custom 
controller in mind. However, it works well enough to get a feel for the game.

The player's health bar is in the bottom right corner, and below it is the hyperdrive
meter. When the hyperdrive meter is totally full, the Kitty jumps to light speed and
escapes the Birds!
